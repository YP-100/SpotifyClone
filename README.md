# SpotifyClone
clone of spotify web app ( i took the inspiration from yt channel - CodeWithHarry)
so i made this clone after getting inspiration from a yt channel named CodeWithHarry(i havent copied the code)
This website fetches song a local host("this will not fetch songs in your devices since i dont have a running server") in song add album of songs in mp3 folder and add the card for the song and then you can play the album from the library container i added 
on mobile i added responsiveness after max width 690 i havent added any responsive css for tablet 
it is made out of plain html,css,js
i hope you find this code useful
